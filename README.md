# 🎥 VideoTube

VideoTube is a full-stack video-sharing platform inspired by YouTube. It allows users to upload videos, like/dislike, comment, subscribe to other users, and even integrates with Twitter for sharing. Built from scratch to sharpen my full-stack skills and simulate a real-world content-sharing experience.
